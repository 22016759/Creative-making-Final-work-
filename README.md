# Creative making: Physical Computing Project Blog!

# Introduction:

Overall, I think I encountered a lot of difficulties from coming up with the idea to completing the project. I felt a lot of pressure at first because I didn't have much contact with ARDUINO before, but fortunately I solved the problem step by step slowly and I felt happy that I actually made it. In fact, after the fourth week, I was in a deep state of fear and helplessness about the presentation I was going to do next week. I was happy to say yes for the sake of security, but this led to a lot of discussion until 4am trying to come up with a design that would work best, so as you can imagine we decided to go our own way in week 5! I probably came up with a lot of ideas, but to be honest when I put them into words I didn't feel confident, at first I was afraid that the design would be boring, and this struggle was a constant part of the process, but then I thought about my design over and over again and I felt that maybe it wouldn't be a meaningful design, but maybe it was a meaningful design practice for me.

I must mention that I had a lot of help from my classmates and teachers in this project. I started from not knowing anything, not knowing how to write code, not knowing how to laser cut, not knowing how to 3D print (although I didn't end up using 3D printing in my project), to finally knowing how to connect input sensors and control multiple output sensors, knowing how to use the laser cutting machine, knowing how to use the 3D printing machine, and how to use the 3D printing machine. Another small lesson I learned in practice is that it is best to solder expansion boards with the positive and negative terminals two rows apart (of course if you are very good at soldering you don't have to do this).

# Week 4

Project Proposal:

Concept:
Accepting and embracing the randomness and uncertainty of life.

Project Name: BOMB BOX

Keywords:

Unknown, Randomness, Indeterminacy, Unexpected, Surprise.

Possible Inputs?

Ultrasonic sensor: Detects the approach of someone with an ultrasonic sensor.

Button: Or the whole device can be turned on with a button, consider a point signal, press and hold the button to inflate the pump and release to stop inflation.

pulse sensor: Detects the heart rate of a person when they engage the device, different people's physical reactions to unknown things.

Possible Outputs?

LED: Visualisation of the heart rate and visualisation of the change in heart rate.

LCD: Reads the heartbeat value.

Buzzer: Provides an audible signal that the balloon is about to explode, creating a tense atmosphere.

Air pump: Requires a device to inflate the balloon.

The teacher's requirements were very simple, in terms of hardware, at least two input sensors and output actuators, and no restrictions on the subject matter. But I found it difficult and unrealistic to imagine, so I have been accumulating inspiration, sometimes from a quote, sometimes from a sudden feeling in my life, and then recording it as much as possible.
